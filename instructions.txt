ADDING NEW POLYGON
Click the new polygon button and then left click on the drawarea to add its vertices. To complete the polygon click on the first vertex.


EDITING POLYGON

- EDGE/VERTEX MOVEMENT 			
Left click on vertex/edge and drag it to new position.
	
- POLYGON MOVEMENT			
Left click inside the polygon and drag it to new position.
	
- ADDING NEW VERTEX ON THE EDGE
Right click on selected edge to add a new vertex.
	
- DELETING VERTEX 				
Right click on vertex to delete it. If polygon has only 3 vertices, this action will delete whole polygon.
	
- DELETING POLYGON				
Right click inide polygon to delete it.


ADDING RELATIONS 

- PARALLEL EDGES
To make two edges parallel click the "Parallelity" button and then select two edges by left-clicking them.

- FIXED LENGTH ON EDGE
To make the length of an edge fixed click on the "Fixed length: button and then on edge that should be affected. You will have to provide desired lenght  in pop-up window.


DELETING RELATIONS
To delete realtions on edges click the "Delete relation" button and then select edge to be affected.

NOTES:
1) You can generate predefined scene with some polygons and relations using "Generate predefined scene" button.
2) One edge can have only one relation.
3) Deleting vertex deletes relations on edges connected to it.
4) Adding vertex on edges deletes relations on present on the edges.
5) Behaviour after adding irrational limitations (for example lengths that do not meet the Triangle Condition) is undefined.
